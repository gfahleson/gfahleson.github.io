    "text": "March used to be a time when Big Ten teams dominated the NCAA tournament. Between 2000 and 2019, the conference sent 16 teams to the Final Four—more than any other conference during that span.\nHowever, this trend has taken a downturn in recent years. Last season, only one of the Big Ten’s eight tournament teams advanced to the Sweet Sixteen. The 2021-22 tournament was even more disappointing, with all five Big Ten teams seeded eighth or higher falling short of expectations.\nSo, what’s behind this decline? Are Big Ten teams underperforming when it matters most, or is this just a streak of bad luck?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nmbb_team_box &lt;- hoopR::load_mbb_team_box(2023)\n\nregularseason23 &lt;- mbb_team_box %&gt;% filter(game_date &gt; \"2022-11-07\" & game_date &lt;= \"2023-03-12\") \n\nbig10 &lt;- c(\"Nebraska\", \"Iowa\", \"Indiana\", \"Illinois\", \"Maryland\", \"Rutgers\", \"Michigan\", \"Michigan St\", \"Ohio State\", \"Penn State\", \"Northwestern\", \"Purdue\", \"Minnesota\", \"Wisconsin\")\nbigregular &lt;- regularseason23 %&gt;%\n  filter(team_short_display_name %in% big10)\n\ntournament &lt;- c(\"Maryland\", \"Illinois\", \"Indiana\", \"Iowa\", \"Michigan St\", \"Northwestern\", \"Penn State\", \"Purdue\")\n\npostseason23 &lt;- mbb_team_box %&gt;% filter(game_date &gt; \"2023-03-14\" & game_date &lt;= \"2023-04-03\")\n\nbigpost &lt;- postseason23 %&gt;%\n  filter(team_short_display_name %in% tournament)\n\nregularthreepct &lt;- bigregular %&gt;% \n  group_by(team_short_display_name) %&gt;% \n  summarise(\n    count = n(),\n    SeasonThreePct = sum(three_point_field_goal_pct),\n    TotalGames = n()\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    ThreePointPct = SeasonThreePct/TotalGames\n  )\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = regularthreepct, aes(x = reorder(team_short_display_name, ThreePointPct), weight = ThreePointPct)) +\n  coord_flip() +\n   labs(\n    x=\"School\", \n    y=\"Three Point Percentage\", \n    title=\"How were Big Ten Teams performing from the Three Point Line?\", \n    subtitle=\"The conference was led by Michigan State in regular season three point percentage\", \n    caption=\"Source: hoopR | By Grace Fahleson\"\n    )   +             \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    title = element_text(color = \"black\", size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 8, color = \"blue\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggsave(\"image.png\")\n\n\nSaving 7 x 5 in image\n\n\nCode\npostthreepct &lt;- bigpost %&gt;% \n  group_by(team_short_display_name) %&gt;% \n  summarise(\n    count = n(),\n    SeasonThreePct = sum(three_point_field_goal_pct),\n    TotalGames = n()\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    ThreePointPct = SeasonThreePct/TotalGames\n  )\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = postthreepct, aes(x = reorder(team_short_display_name, ThreePointPct), weight = ThreePointPct)) +\n  coord_flip() +\n   labs(\n    x=\"School\", \n    y=\"Three Point Percentage\", \n    title=\"How did Big Ten teams shoot the three in the post season?\", \n    subtitle=\"Penn State took over having the best three point percentage in the NCAA tournament\", \n    caption=\"Source: hoopR | By Hollan Griesch\"\n    )   +             \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    title = element_text(color = \"black\", size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 8, color = \"blue\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the regular season, every Big Ten team managed to shoot above 30% from beyond the arc.\nYet, come NCAA tournament time, four of the conference’s eight teams fell below that threshold. Penn State stood out as the lone exception, improving its three-point shooting from the regular season to the postseason.\nOf course, the headline story from this year’s tournament was the shocking upset of top-seeded Purdue by 16th-seeded Fairleigh Dickinson. So, what exactly went wrong for the Boilermakers during March Madness? Let’s break it down."
