    "section": "",
    "text": "March used to be a time when Big Ten teams dominated the NCAA tournament. Between 2000 and 2019, the conference sent 16 teams to the Final Four—more than any other conference during that span.\nHowever, this trend has taken a downturn in recent years. In 2021, only one of the Big Ten’s eight tournament teams advanced to the Sweet Sixteen. The 2022 tournament was even more disappointing, with all five Big Ten teams seeded eighth or higher falling short of expectations. 2023 was even more unfortunate for the conference as their top team representing the conference fell to a 16 seed in the first round.\nSo, what’s behind this decline? Are Big Ten teams underperforming when it matters most, or is this just a streak of bad luck?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nmbb_team_box &lt;- hoopR::load_mbb_team_box(2023)\n\nregularseason23 &lt;- mbb_team_box %&gt;% filter(game_date &gt; \"2022-11-07\" & game_date &lt;= \"2023-03-12\") \n\nbig10 &lt;- c(\"Nebraska\", \"Iowa\", \"Indiana\", \"Illinois\", \"Maryland\", \"Rutgers\", \"Michigan\", \"Michigan St\", \"Ohio State\", \"Penn State\", \"Northwestern\", \"Purdue\", \"Minnesota\", \"Wisconsin\")\nbigregular &lt;- regularseason23 %&gt;%\n  filter(team_short_display_name %in% big10)\n\ntournament &lt;- c(\"Maryland\", \"Illinois\", \"Indiana\", \"Iowa\", \"Michigan St\", \"Northwestern\", \"Penn State\", \"Purdue\")\n\npostseason23 &lt;- mbb_team_box %&gt;% filter(game_date &gt; \"2023-03-14\" & game_date &lt;= \"2023-04-03\")\n\nbigpost &lt;- postseason23 %&gt;%\n  filter(team_short_display_name %in% tournament)\n\nregularthreepct &lt;- bigregular %&gt;% \n  group_by(team_short_display_name) %&gt;% \n  summarise(\n    count = n(),\n    SeasonThreePct = sum(three_point_field_goal_pct),\n    TotalGames = n()\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    ThreePointPct = SeasonThreePct/TotalGames\n  )\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = regularthreepct, aes(x = reorder(team_short_display_name, ThreePointPct), weight = ThreePointPct)) +\n  coord_flip() +\n   labs(\n    x=\"School\", \n    y=\"Three Point Percentage\", \n    title=\"How were Big Ten Teams performing from the Three Point Line?\", \n    subtitle=\"The conference was led by Michigan State in regular season three point percentage\", \n    caption=\"Source: hoopR | By Grace Fahleson\"\n    )   +             \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    title = element_text(color = \"black\", size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 8, color = \"blue\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\npostthreepct &lt;- bigpost %&gt;% \n  group_by(team_short_display_name) %&gt;% \n  summarise(\n    count = n(),\n    SeasonThreePct = sum(three_point_field_goal_pct),\n    TotalGames = n()\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    ThreePointPct = SeasonThreePct/TotalGames\n  )\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = postthreepct, aes(x = reorder(team_short_display_name, ThreePointPct), weight = ThreePointPct)) +\n  coord_flip() +\n   labs(\n    x=\"School\", \n    y=\"Three Point Percentage\", \n    title=\"How did Big Ten teams shoot the three in the post season?\", \n    subtitle=\"Penn State took over having the best three point percentage in the NCAA tournament\", \n    caption=\"Source: hoopR | By Grace Fahleson\"\n    )   +             \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    title = element_text(color = \"black\", size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 8, color = \"blue\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the regular season, every Big Ten team managed to shoot above 30% from beyond the arc.\nYet, come NCAA tournament time, four of the conference’s eight teams fell below that threshold. Penn State stood out as the lone exception, improving its three-point shooting from the regular season to the postseason.\nOf course, the headline story from this year’s tournament was the shocking upset of top-seeded Purdue by 16th-seeded Fairleigh Dickinson. So, what exactly went wrong for the Boilermakers during March Madness?

Along with a drop in their three-point shooting, this decline in offensive efficiency brought troubles for the Boilermakers.\nOffensive struggles weren’t unique to Purdue—six of the Big Ten’s eight tournament teams experienced a decline in shooting compared to their regular-season performance.\nWith offenses on the edge, the question becomes: did these teams make-up for their scoring struggles with strong defensive play? Let’s take a closer look.\n\n\nCode\nturnovers &lt;- bigpost %&gt;%\n  group_by(team_short_display_name) %&gt;%\n  summarise (\n    Giveaways = sum(total_turnovers),\n    Takeaways = sum(steals)) %&gt;%\nrename(Team = team_short_display_name)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=turnovers, \n    aes(y=Team, x=Takeaways, xend=Giveaways),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"blue\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    title=\"Did Big Ten team's win the turnover battle in the postseason?\", \n    subtitle = \"No Big Ten team had more steals than turnovers in the tournament\",\n    caption=\"Source: hoopR | By Grace Fahleson\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    title = element_text(color = \"black\", size  =   14, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size   =   11),\n    axis.text = element_text(size  =    8, color = \"black\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBig Ten teams failed to win the turnover battle in the NCAA tournament, and when paired with their offensive struggles, it led to yet another disappointing postseason for the conference.\nThe recent trend of underperformance in March Madness raises a pressing question: is this simply bad luck? The numbers suggest otherwise. With Big Ten teams consistently underperforming in nearly every statistical category during the postseason compared to the regular season, the issues run deeper than just poor luck.\nThe pressure is on for the conference to reverse this trend. It’s been over two decades since Michigan State delivered the Big Ten’s last national championship in 2000. Can the conference reclaim its former glory? Only time will tell."

    "title": "The ‘Playoff Jimmy’ Phenomenom",
    "section": "",
    "text": "I’ve never been a die-hard NBA fan. I rarely watch in the regular season, and I truly don’t find it as exciting to watch as college basketball. I usually just tune in during the postseason so I can stay in the loop. However, I became rather intrigued with one player in particular a few years ago when watching the playoffs during COVID-19, and that player sparked my idea for this project topic. Jimmy Butler. Specifically, “Playoff Jimmy”.\nThere is no doubt that Jimmy Butler has been a star in the NBA since he came into the league in 2011. However, when looking at his stats I believe that the impact he has had, particularly in the postseason, is significantly underrated. Butler earned the nickname “Playoff Jimmy” during his performance in the NBA bubble in the 2020 postseason when he led the Heat all the way to the finals. This marked the first time since 1999 that a team seeded 5th or lower made it to the finals.\nIn the 2023 postseason, Butler shined brightly and stepped up his game more than ever. Butler led the No.8 Heat past the top-seeded Milwaukee Bucks in just five games. This feat was extra impressive as his 56 points were tied for the fourth-most ever in a playoff game – only Michael Jordan, Elgin Baylor and Donovan Mitchell have scored more.\nLet’s look back on past playoffs to see where Jimmy Butler ranks among some of the league’s best when it comes to his performances in the postseason.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nnbaplayerbox &lt;- hoopR::load_nba_player_box(2022)\n\npostseason2022 &lt;- nbaplayerbox %&gt;% filter(game_date &gt; \"2022-04-16\" & game_date &lt;= \"2022-06-16\")\n\nplayers &lt;- c(\"Jimmy Butler\", \"James Harden\", \"Stephen Curry\", \"Giannis Antetokounmpo\",\"Klay Thompson\")\n\nnewnba &lt;- postseason2022 %&gt;% \n  filter(athlete_display_name %in% players) %&gt;%\n  select(athlete_display_name, field_goals_made, field_goals_attempted, steals, rebounds, points) %&gt;%\n  mutate_at(vars(-athlete_display_name), as.numeric) %&gt;%\n  group_by(athlete_display_name) %&gt;%\n  summarize(\n    TotalFG = sum(field_goals_made),\n    TotalFGA = sum(field_goals_attempted),\n    Steals = sum(steals),\n    Rebounds = sum(rebounds),\n    Points = sum(points)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(FGPct = TotalFG/TotalFGA) %&gt;%\n  rename(Name = athlete_display_name) %&gt;%\n  select(Name, FGPct, Steals, Rebounds, Points) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(FGPct))\n\nnewnba %&gt;% \n  gt() %&gt;%\n  cols_label(\n    FGPct = \"Shooting Percentage\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"How Jimmy Butler Ranks in Playoff Shooting Percentage\",\n    subtitle = \"Butler tops the list with the best shooting percentage in the 2022 playoffs\"\n  ) %&gt;% tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) %&gt;% tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) %&gt;%\n tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Grace Fahleson  |  **Source:** hoopR: The SportsDataverse's R Package for Men's Basketball Data\")\n  ) %&gt;%\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) %&gt;%\n  opt_row_striping () %&gt;%\n  opt_table_lines (\"none\") %&gt;%\n  fmt_percent(\n    column = c(FGPct),\n    decimals = 1\n  ) %&gt;%\n    tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"red\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Name == \"Jimmy Butler\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow Jimmy Butler Ranks in Playoff Shooting Percentage\n\n\nButler tops the list with the best shooting percentage in the 2022 playoffs\n\n\nName\nShooting Percentage\nSteals\nRebounds\nPoints\n\n\n\n\nJimmy Butler\n50.6%\n35\n125\n466\n\n\nGiannis Antetokounmpo\n49.1%\n8\n170\n380\n\n\nStephen Curry\n46.1%\n28\n112\n586\n\n\nKlay Thompson\n42.8%\n24\n83\n400\n\n\nJames Harden\n41.1%\n8\n63\n201\n\n\n\nBy: Grace Fahleson | Source: hoopR: The SportsDataverse’s R Package for Men’s Basketball Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggsave(\"image.png\")\n\n\nWhen the playoffs roll around Jimmy Butler takes his game to another level. Compared to some of the leagues best shooters, Butler held the highest shooting percentage. He shot over 50% from the field in the 2022 postseason and also led these players in steals.\nAmong this list he was second in rebounds only to Giannis Antetokounmpo which is not surprising and trailed only Steph Curry in total points. However, Curry also played in six more games then Butler as he led the Warriors to another championship.\nLets take a closer look at how Butler’s point totals during the 2022 postseason compared to the league average.\n\n\nCode\naverage &lt;- nbaplayerbox %&gt;% \n  summarise(mean_points = mean(points, na.rm=TRUE))\n\nbutler &lt;- nbaplayerbox %&gt;% filter(athlete_display_name == \"Jimmy Butler\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=butler, aes(x=game_date, y=points), color = \"red\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 10.41) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 50)) +\n   labs(y = \"Points\",\n        x = \"Game Date\",\n       title = \"Jimmy Butler's Postseason Point Totals\",\n       subtitle = \"Butler far exceeded the league average in points scored during the postseason\",\n      caption=\" By Grace Fahleson | Source: hoopR: The SportsDataverse's R Package for Men's Basketball Data\") +\n  theme_minimal() + \n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 16, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 10),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 12),\n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButler’s impact on the court goes well beyond just the points that he scores. He is also an elite defender and gets the task of guarding the other team’s best player nearly every game. His hustle and leadership while on the court also consistently provide a spark for the Heat.\nThere is a noticeable difference in the intensity and pace of the game for Miami when their star is on the court versus when he is not, and this impact isn’t something that point totals alone can show.\nLet’s look at how Butler’s impact on the game compares to other prominent players at his same position in the league.\n\n\nCode\nnewplayers &lt;- c(\"Jimmy Butler\", \"Jayson Tatum\", \"Khris Middleton\", \"Jaylen Brown\", \"Klay Thompson\")\n\nnbaplayers &lt;- postseason2022 %&gt;% \n  filter(athlete_display_name %in% newplayers)\n\nnewnbaplayers &lt;- nbaplayers %&gt;%\n  mutate(plus_minus = as.numeric(plus_minus))\n\nnbadata &lt;- newnbaplayers %&gt;% \n  group_by(athlete_display_name) %&gt;% \n  summarise(\n    count = n(),\n    TotalPlusMinus = sum(plus_minus),\n    TotalGames = n()\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    PlusMinus = TotalPlusMinus/TotalGames\n  )\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=nbadata, aes(x=reorder(athlete_display_name, PlusMinus), weight=PlusMinus)) +\n  coord_flip() +\n     labs(\n    x=\"Name\", \n    y=\"Plus Minus\", \n    title=\"Small Forwards Plus Minus in the 2021-22 Playoffs\", \n    subtitle=\"Jimmy Butler topped this group in average plus minus during the postseason\", \n    caption=\"Source: hoopR The SportsDataverse's R Package for Men's Basketball Data | By Grace Fahleson\"\n    )   +             \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    title = element_text(color = \"black\", size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 8, color = \"black\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong some of the leagues best small forwards, Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown, Klay Thompson, and Khris Middleton, Jimmy Butler tops the list for best plus minus. Plus minus keeps track of the net changes in the score when a given player is either on or off the court.\nThe Miami Heat were five and a half points better when Jimmy Butler was on the court last postseason. These five points can make the difference in a tight playoff game when it comes down to the final stretch.\nClearly, Butler is the driving force behind the Heat’s success the past couple seasons and his playoff performances will be something that Heat fans and people like myself will remember forever."
