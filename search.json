    "title": "Did the Big Ten Lack in their Performance During the 2023 NCAA Tournamnet?",
    "section": "",
    "text": "March used to be a time when Big Ten teams dominated the NCAA tournament. Between 2000 and 2019, the conference sent 16 teams to the Final Four—more than any other conference during that span.\nHowever, this trend has taken a downturn in recent years. In 2021, only one of the Big Ten’s eight tournament teams advanced to the Sweet Sixteen. The 2022 tournament was even more disappointing, with all five Big Ten teams seeded eighth or higher falling short of expectations. 2023 was even more unfortunate for the conference as their top team representing the conference fell to a 16 seed in the first round.\nSo, what’s behind this decline? Are Big Ten teams underperforming when it matters most, or is this just a streak of bad luck?\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(gt)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\nmbb_team_box &lt;- hoopR::load_mbb_team_box(2023)\n\nregularseason23 &lt;- mbb_team_box %&gt;% filter(game_date &gt; \"2022-11-07\" & game_date &lt;= \"2023-03-12\") \n\nbig10 &lt;- c(\"Nebraska\", \"Iowa\", \"Indiana\", \"Illinois\", \"Maryland\", \"Rutgers\", \"Michigan\", \"Michigan St\", \"Ohio State\", \"Penn State\", \"Northwestern\", \"Purdue\", \"Minnesota\", \"Wisconsin\")\nbigregular &lt;- regularseason23 %&gt;%\n  filter(team_short_display_name %in% big10)\n\ntournament &lt;- c(\"Maryland\", \"Illinois\", \"Indiana\", \"Iowa\", \"Michigan St\", \"Northwestern\", \"Penn State\", \"Purdue\")\n\npostseason23 &lt;- mbb_team_box %&gt;% filter(game_date &gt; \"2023-03-14\" & game_date &lt;= \"2023-04-03\")\n\nbigpost &lt;- postseason23 %&gt;%\n  filter(team_short_display_name %in% tournament)\n\nregularthreepct &lt;- bigregular %&gt;% \n  group_by(team_short_display_name) %&gt;% \n  summarise(\n    count = n(),\n    SeasonThreePct = sum(three_point_field_goal_pct),\n    TotalGames = n()\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    ThreePointPct = SeasonThreePct/TotalGames\n  )\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = regularthreepct, aes(x = reorder(team_short_display_name, ThreePointPct), weight = ThreePointPct)) +\n  coord_flip() +\n   labs(\n    x=\"School\", \n    y=\"Three Point Percentage\", \n    title=\"How were Big Ten Teams performing from the Three Point Line?\", \n    subtitle=\"The conference was led by Michigan State in regular season three point percentage\", \n    caption=\"Source: hoopR | By Grace Fahleson\"\n    )   +             \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    title = element_text(color = \"black\", size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 8, color = \"blue\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\npostthreepct &lt;- bigpost %&gt;% \n  group_by(team_short_display_name) %&gt;% \n  summarise(\n    count = n(),\n    SeasonThreePct = sum(three_point_field_goal_pct),\n    TotalGames = n()\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    ThreePointPct = SeasonThreePct/TotalGames\n  )\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_bar(data = postthreepct, aes(x = reorder(team_short_display_name, ThreePointPct), weight = ThreePointPct)) +\n  coord_flip() +\n   labs(\n    x=\"School\", \n    y=\"Three Point Percentage\", \n    title=\"How did Big Ten teams shoot the three in the post season?\", \n    subtitle=\"Penn State took over having the best three point percentage in the NCAA tournament\", \n    caption=\"Source: hoopR | By Grace Fahleson\"\n    )   +             \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    title = element_text(color = \"black\", size = 10, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size = 8),\n    plot.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\"),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 8, color = \"blue\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the regular season, every Big Ten team managed to shoot above 30% from beyond the arc.\nYet, come NCAA tournament time, four of the conference’s eight teams fell below that threshold. Penn State stood out as the lone exception, improving its three-point shooting from the regular season to the postseason.\nOf course, the headline story from this year’s tournament was the shocking upset of top-seeded Purdue by 16th-seeded Fairleigh Dickinson. So, what exactly went wrong for the Boilermakers during March Madness? Let’s break it down.\n\n\nCode\nbigmbb &lt;- bigregular %&gt;%\n  select(team_short_display_name, field_goals_attempted, field_goals_made, field_goal_pct) %&gt;%\n  mutate_at(vars(-team_short_display_name), as.numeric) %&gt;%\n  group_by(team_short_display_name) %&gt;%\n  summarize(\n    TotalFG = sum(field_goals_made),\n    TotalFGA = sum(field_goals_attempted)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(FGPct = TotalFG/TotalFGA) %&gt;%\n  rename(Team = team_short_display_name) %&gt;%\n  select(Team, FGPct) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(FGPct)) \n\nbigmbb %&gt;%\n  gt() %&gt;%\n  cols_label(\n    FGPct = \"Shooting Percentage\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"How did the Big Ten's best team shoot in the regular season?\",\n    subtitle = \"Purdue was third in field goal percentage before the NCAA tournament\"\n  ) %&gt;% tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) %&gt;% tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) %&gt;%\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Grace Fahleson  |  **Source:** hoopR\")\n ) %&gt;%\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) %&gt;%\n  opt_row_striping() %&gt;% \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") %&gt;%\n  fmt_percent(\n    columns = c(FGPct),\n    decimals = 1\n  ) %&gt;%\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"gold\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Team == \"Purdue\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow did the Big Ten's best team shoot in the regular season?\n\n\nPurdue was third in field goal percentage before the NCAA tournament\n\n\nTeam\nShooting Percentage\n\n\n\n\nIndiana\n48.5%\n\n\nPenn State\n46.1%\n\n\nPurdue\n45.9%\n\n\nOhio State\n45.9%\n\n\nNebraska\n45.7%\n\n\nIowa\n45.3%\n\n\nIllinois\n45.0%\n\n\nMichigan St\n45.0%\n\n\nMaryland\n44.8%\n\n\nMichigan\n44.6%\n\n\nMinnesota\n43.3%\n\n\nRutgers\n42.8%\n\n\nWisconsin\n41.1%\n\n\nNorthwestern\n40.5%\n\n\n\nBy: Grace Fahleson | Source: hoopR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nbigpostmbb &lt;- bigpost %&gt;%\n  select(team_short_display_name, field_goals_attempted, field_goals_made, field_goal_pct) %&gt;%\n  mutate_at(vars(-team_short_display_name), as.numeric) %&gt;%\n  group_by(team_short_display_name) %&gt;%\n  summarize(\n    TotalFG = sum(field_goals_made),\n    TotalFGA = sum(field_goals_attempted)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  mutate(FGPct = TotalFG/TotalFGA) %&gt;%\n  rename(Team = team_short_display_name) %&gt;%\n  select(Team, FGPct) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(FGPct))\n\nbigpostmbb %&gt;%\n  gt() %&gt;%\n  cols_label(\n    FGPct = \"Shooting Percentage\"\n  ) %&gt;%\n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Now how did they shoot in the post season?\",\n    subtitle = \"Purdue was at the bottom of the Big Ten for shooting percentage in the NCAA tournament\"\n  ) %&gt;% tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) %&gt;% tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) %&gt;%\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Grace Fahleson  |  **Source:** hoopR\")\n ) %&gt;%\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) %&gt;%\n  opt_row_striping() %&gt;% \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") %&gt;%\n  fmt_percent(\n    columns = c(FGPct),\n    decimals = 1\n  ) %&gt;%\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"gold\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"white\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = Team == \"Purdue\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow how did they shoot in the post season?\n\n\nPurdue was at the bottom of the Big Ten for shooting percentage in the NCAA tournament\n\n\nTeam\nShooting Percentage\n\n\n\n\nMichigan St\n47.4%\n\n\nPenn State\n44.8%\n\n\nIndiana\n44.0%\n\n\nNorthwestern\n42.9%\n\n\nMaryland\n42.4%\n\n\nIowa\n41.2%\n\n\nIllinois\n38.5%\n\n\nPurdue\n35.8%\n\n\n\nBy: Grace Fahleson | Source: hoopR\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen the postseason arrived, Purdue’s field goal percentage plummeted by a 10%. Along with a drop in their three-point shooting, this decline in offensive efficiency brought troubles for the Boilermakers.\nOffensive struggles weren’t unique to Purdue—six of the Big Ten’s eight tournament teams experienced a decline in shooting compared to their regular-season performance.\nWith offenses on the edge, the question becomes: did these teams make-up for their scoring struggles with strong defensive play? Let’s take a closer look.\n\n\nCode\nturnovers &lt;- bigpost %&gt;%\n  group_by(team_short_display_name) %&gt;%\n  summarise (\n    Giveaways = sum(total_turnovers),\n    Takeaways = sum(steals)) %&gt;%\nrename(Team = team_short_display_name)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=turnovers, \n    aes(y=Team, x=Takeaways, xend=Giveaways),\n    size = 2,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"blue\",\n    colour_xend = \"red\") +\n  labs(\n    title=\"Did Big Ten team's win the turnover battle in the postseason?\", \n    subtitle = \"No Big Ten team had more steals than turnovers in the tournament\",\n    caption=\"Source: hoopR | By Grace Fahleson\"\n  ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    title = element_text(color = \"black\", size  =   14, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size   =   11),\n    axis.text = element_text(size  =    8, color = \"black\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBig Ten teams failed to win the turnover battle in the NCAA tournament, and when paired with their offensive struggles, it led to yet another disappointing postseason for the conference.\nThe recent trend of underperformance in March Madness raises a pressing question: is this simply bad luck? The numbers suggest otherwise. With Big Ten teams consistently underperforming in nearly every statistical category during the postseason compared to the regular season, the issues run deeper than just poor luck.\nThe pressure is on for the conference to reverse this trend. It’s been over two decades since Michigan State delivered the Big Ten’s last national championship in 2000. Can the conference reclaim its former glory? Only time will tell."
